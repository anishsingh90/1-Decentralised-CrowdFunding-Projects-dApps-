# 🌐 Crowdfunding Platform 🚀  

Welcome to the **Crowdfunding Platform**, a decentralized application (**dApp**) built on the Ethereum blockchain! 🛠️  
This project empowers creators and contributors by enabling **secure**, **transparent**, and **trustless** fundraising experiences — without relying on third parties. 💰✨

## ✨ Features  

- 📢 **Launch Campaigns**: Start your fundraising with a title, description, target amount, deadline, and image.  
- 💸 **Contribute Seamlessly**: Support any campaign using ETH directly from your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc).  
- 👁️‍🗨️ **Transparent Fund Flow**: Real-time tracking of donations and contributor details on-chain.  
- ⛓️ **Decentralized & Trustless**: No middlemen — funds are transferred directly to the campaign creator via smart contracts.
